## Definition

- Amplitude of the carrier signal is changed according to the modulating signal(original signal/baseband).

## Working

- A high frequency signal is chosen for carrier signal.
- Both carrier signal and modulating signal is passed through the AM circuit.
- New modulated signal is transmitted through antennas.

## Advantages and disadvantages of AM

### Advantages
- Atmosphere propagation provides wider coverage than that of FM.
- Cheap circuit.
- It can be demodulated using diode detector.
- It propagates longer distances because of its high power.
### Disadvantages
- Filtering noise and interference is difficult.
- It's not strong enough after passing through obstacles.
- Poor power efficiency.
- Cannot recover original message in a high noise and interference environment.
