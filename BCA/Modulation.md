# Definition

1. Modulating signal: the original signal or baseband is know as modulating signal.
2. Carrier signal: the signal whose property or parameter are going to be changed with respect to modulating signal.
3. Modulated signal: the new signal after changing the carrier signal is modulated signal.

# Benefits of modulation

- It help the transmission of signal to a longer distances.
- It provides some control over noise and interferences.
- It changes the frequency band to a match the frequency band of antennas' physical aperture frequency.
