### 1. Discuss the need of modulation in computer network. Also, differentiate between the Amplitude and Frequency Modulation.

- When a signal is transmitted to a larger distance, it looses its strength.
- We modify the signal to cover the lager distances.
- The receiver then demodulates the signal to the original message(baseband).

| Differences         | Amplitude Modulation                                                                                                            | Frequency Modulation                                                                                |
