## Part 1

### 1. Discuss the need of modulation in computer network. Also, differentiate between the Amplitude and Frequency Modulation.

- When a signal is transmitted to a larger distance, it looses its strength.
- We modify the signal to cover the lager distances.
- The receiver then demodulates the signal to the original message(baseband).

| Differences         | Amplitude Modulation                                                                                                            | Frequency Modulation                                                                                |

### 3. Why network models are divided into layers ? Write the similarities between TCP/IP and OSI model.

- Network model is divided into layers for better scalability, stability, clarity and modularity.
- Network model is divided into small functional units instead of one massive, complex system.
- Reasons of it being divided:
	- **Modularity:** easy trouble shooting, making new network design.
	- **Interoperability:** vendor can develop a productor for one layer without implementing the entire model.
	- **Standardization:** layers defines rules and protocols that ensure devices and network communicate universally.
	- **Isolation of changes:** change of one protocol doesn't affect other layers.
	- **Isolation efficiency:** network issue can be isolated to a specific layer.
	- **Scalability and flexibility:** new technologies can be added without redesigning the entire model.

- Similarities of OSI and TCP/IP:

| Features                       | OSI Model                  | TCP/IP                    | Similarities                                |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Layered Architecture           | 7-Layer                    | 4-Layer                   | Both uses layered Approch                   |
| Communication Method           | End-to-End                 | End-to-End                | Both focus on reliable data communication   |
| Standardization                | International Standard     | Industry Standard         | Both define standards for interoperability. |
| Encapsualtion                  | Yes                        | Yes                       | Data is passed through layers with headers. |
| Protocol Independence          | Protocol-agnostic          | Protocol-agnostic         | Both models support multiple protocol.      |
| Flow control and error control | Transport layer handle it. | Transport layer handle it | Ensures reliable transmission.              |
| Network layer                  | Responsible for routing    | Internet Layer            | Both manage addressing and routing.         |
